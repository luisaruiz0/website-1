            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a middle child of two brothers. I use to play soccer and tennis
                but I am currently retired on both. Something about me is that I tend to forget 
                the basic things, but remember odd stuff that other people would have forgotten.
            </p>

                    <p>I play video games to pass time and have fun playing with friends.
                        It can also be used to release stress of a hard days work.
                        Although at times, it can make you irritated instead.
                        Some games I play are: Rainbow 6 Siege, bo2, bo3

                <p>For me, ping pong is something I do to pass time 
                    waiting for other classes to begin. Its become more fun as we
                    play with new people and other friends. At times, it gets tiring.
