            </center>
            <p>I am a middle child of two brothers. I use to play soccer and tennis
                but I am currently retired on both. Something about me is that I tend to forget 
                the basic things, but remember odd stuff that other people would have forgotten.
            </p>

                <p>For me, ping pong is something I do to pass time 
                    waiting for other classes to begin. Its become more fun as we
                    play with new people and other friends. At times, it gets tiring.></a>
